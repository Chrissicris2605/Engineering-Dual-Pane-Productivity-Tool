# 🖥️ Engineering Dual-Pane Productivity Tool

**Case Study – Desktop Application for Engineering Workflows**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project represents a **case study of a desktop productivity tool** designed to improve engineering workflows by synchronizing **technical drawings** and **structured data** side by side.

The tool was created to reduce context switching, improve understanding, and drastically shorten onboarding time for new team members.

## 🚩 Problem

Engineering teams often work with:
- Large technical drawings (images, schematics)
- Complex spreadsheets or structured datasets
- Multiple tools and windows open simultaneously

### Before the tool:
- ❌ Constant context switching
- 🧠 High cognitive load
- 🕒 Long onboarding time for new engineers
- 📉 Reduced productivity and understanding

---

## ✅ Solution

I designed and implemented a **dual-pane desktop application** that:
- Displays technical drawings on one side
- Displays structured data on the other
- Keeps context aligned visually and logically
- Enables faster interpretation and decision-making

The tool was designed with **clarity and usability** as top priorities.
