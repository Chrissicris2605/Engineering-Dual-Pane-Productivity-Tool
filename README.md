# 🖥️ Engineering Dual-Pane Productivity Tool

**Case Study – Desktop Application for Engineering Workflows**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project represents a **case study of a desktop productivity tool** designed to improve engineering workflows by synchronizing **technical drawings** and **structured data** side by side.

The tool was created to reduce context switching, improve understanding, and drastically shorten onboarding time for new team members in complex technical environments.

---

## 🚩 Problem

Engineering teams often work with:
- Large technical drawings (schematics, wiring diagrams, blueprints)
- Complex spreadsheets or structured datasets
- Multiple tools and windows open simultaneously

### Before the tool:
- ❌ Constant context switching between files and tools  
- 🧠 High cognitive load to correlate visual and tabular information  
- 🕒 Long onboarding time for new engineers  
- 📉 Reduced productivity and higher dependency on senior team members  

---

## ✅ Solution

I designed and implemented a **dual-pane desktop application** that:
- Displays technical drawings on one side
- Displays structured data on the other
- Keeps visual and data context aligned
- Enables faster interpretation and decision-making

The application prioritizes:
- Clarity over complexity  
- Usability for both experienced and junior engineers  
- Minimal training requirements  

---

## 📈 Impact

- ⏱️ Reduced task execution time by **~50%**
- 🎓 Enabled new engineers to become productive after **~1 hour of training**
- 🧠 Improved understanding of complex engineering artifacts
- 🔁 Reduced onboarding dependency on senior engineers

## 📦 Code Availability

This project is presented as a **technical case study**.

The original application contains proprietary logic and client-specific integrations developed under a confidentiality agreement.  
For this reason, the source code is **not publicly shared**.

The focus of this repository is to document:
- the problem being solved
- the solution approach
- architectural and UX decisions
- and the measurable impact of the tool

---

## 🔒 Legal & Confidentiality

- No proprietary assets are included  
- No production datasets are shared  
- No company or client identifiers are exposed  

This repository is intended solely for **professional and educational demonstration purposes**.

## 🧭 Why This Matters

This case study demonstrates my ability to:
- Design intuitive desktop applications
- Optimize real-world engineering workflows
- Reduce onboarding friction
- Deliver production-grade internal tools with measurable impact
